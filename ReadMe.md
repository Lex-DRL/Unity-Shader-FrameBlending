# Unity-Shader-FrameBlending

A small shader-lib package providing smooth (frame-blended) playback functions for sprite sheets (aka "particle textures").

ShaderGraph supported, sub-graph included.

Package is marked as compatible with Unity `2022.3.8f1` and URP `14.0.8`, but it probably works with **MUCH** lower versions. Though, it's not tested (try by yourself).

## INSTALLATION

Just clone it into your `UnityProject/Packages` folder, as `com.darlog.frame-blending` subfolder.
