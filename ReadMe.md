# Unity-Shader-FrameBlending

A small shader-lib package providing smooth (frame-blended) playback functions for sprite sheets (aka "particle textures").

ShaderGraph supported, sub-graph included.

Package is marked as compatible with Unity `2022.3.8f1` / URP `14.0.8` and up, but it probably works with **MUCH** lower versions. Though, it's not tested (try by yourself, but you'll need to edit versions in `package.json`).

## INSTALLATION

Just clone it into your `UnityProject/Packages` folder, as `com.darlog.frame-blending` subfolder.
